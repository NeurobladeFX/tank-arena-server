## 📊 Image Naming System

### Implemented Format:
```
[vehicle]_[level]_[part].png
```

### Examples:
```
tank_basic_body.png      ✅ Working
tank_elite_turret.png    ✅ Working
jeep_basic_body.png      ✅ Working
apc_heavy_body.png       ⏳ Ready to add
mech_titan_turret.png    ⏳ Ready to add
```

### Supported Levels:

- **Helicopter**: basic, attack, gunship, heavy, elite
- **Mech**: basic, assault, heavy, battle, titan

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### ✅ Ready for Render:
- [x] Server runs on configurable PORT
- [x] Health check endpoint available
- [x] All dependencies in package.json
- [x] Static files properly configured
- [x] WebSocket support enabled
- [x] Production-ready error handling

### To Deploy (5 minutes):
1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect to Render
3. Deploy!

See `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` for detailed steps.

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### When Game Loads:
1. **Attempts to load all images** from `/assets/`
2. **Logs success/failure** for each image
3. **Uses images** when available
4. **Falls back to shapes** when not available
5. **No errors** - everything works either way!

### When Drawing Vehicles:
1. **Checks if image exists** for current vehicle + level
2. **If yes** → Draws the image
3. **If no** → Draws colored shape (still looks good!)
4. **Seamless experience** for players

### When Adding New Images:
1. **Drop PNG in `/assets/`** folder
2. **Name it correctly** (follow naming guide)
3. **Restart server** (or redeploy)
4. **Image automatically used!** ✨
