# 🔧 Bug Fixes & Updates - Vehicle Image Integration

## Fixed Issues

### ✅ **1. Missing Vehicle Images Loaded**
**Problem:** Only Tank and partial Jeep images were being loaded.

**Solution:** Updated imageMap to load all 56 vehicle images:
- Added all APC levels (10 images)
- Added all Artillery levels (10 images)  
- Added all Helicopter levels (6 images - 5 bodies + 1 shared rotor)
- Total: 56 images now loading automatically

**Files Changed:**
- [`game.js`](file://e:\tank-arena\public\game.js) - Lines 468-527

---

### ✅ **2. Level Name Mapping Fixed**
**Problem:** Game was looking for wrong level names that didn't match your uploaded images.

**Old (Broken) Mappings:**
```javascript
apc:        { 4: 'assault', 5: 'titan' }  // ❌ Wrong!
artillery:  { 3: 'siege', 4: 'mobile', 5: 'super' }  // ❌ Wrong!
helicopter: { 4: 'heavy' }  // ❌ Wrong!
```

**New (Fixed) Mappings:**
```javascript
apc:        { 4: 'commando', 5: 'elite' }  // ✅ Matches your files!
artillery:  { 3: 'battle', 4: 'plasma', 5: 'elite' }  // ✅ Matches your files!
helicopter: { 4: 'stealth' }  // ✅ Matches your files!
```

**Files Changed:**
- [`game.js`](file://e:\tank-arena\public\game.js) - `drawVehicleBody()` and `drawTurret()` methods

---

### ✅ **3. Helicopter Special Rotor System**
**Problem:** Helicopters have different bodies but share ONE rotor image for all levels.

**Solution:** Created special handling for helicopters:
- Detects helicopter vehicle type
- Uses shared `helicopter_basic_rotor.png` for ALL helicopter levels
- Added **spinning animation** to the rotor (realistic effect!)
- Rotor rotates continuously while body stays level-specific

**Code Added:**
```javascript
drawTurret() {
    // Special handling for helicopter - uses shared rotor
    if (this.vehicleType === 'helicopter') {
        const rotorImage = vehicleImages.helicopter.rotor.rotor;
        if (rotorImage) {
            ctx.rotate((Date.now() / 50) % (Math.PI * 2)); // Spin!
            ctx.drawImage(rotorImage, ...);
        }
    }
    // ... rest of code
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- [`game.js`](file://e:\tank-arena\public\game.js) - `drawTurret()` method

---

### ✅ **4. Vehicle Image Data Structure Updated**
**Problem:** Image storage object didn't have slots for all levels.

**Old Structure:**
```javascript
apc: { base: {} },  // ❌ Only 1 level!
artillery: { base: {} },  // ❌ Only 1 level!
helicopter: { base: {} },  // ❌ Only 1 level!
```

**New Structure:**
```javascript
apc: { base: {}, heavy: {}, battle: {}, commando: {}, elite: {} },  // ✅ All 5!
artillery: { base: {}, heavy: {}, battle: {}, plasma: {}, elite: {} },  // ✅ All 5!
helicopter: { base: {}, attack: {}, gunship: {}, stealth: {}, elite: {}, rotor: null },  // ✅ All 5 + rotor!
```

**Files Changed:**
- [`game.js`](file://e:\tank-arena\public\game.js) - `vehicleImages` object

## 🎮 Upgrade Level System Status

### ✅ **Upgrade System Working Correctly**

The upgrade system was already working, but now it will properly show images:

1. **Reach XP threshold** → Level up screen appears
2. **Select vehicle** → Can choose same type or switch
3. **Confirm** → New level with new image loads
4. **Images change automatically** based on level

**Server-side upgrade handler** (already working):
- File: [`server.js`](file://e:\tank-arena\server.js) - Lines 453-465
- Handles vehicle upgrades
- Updates player stats
- Broadcasts to all clients

**Client-side upgrade handler** (already working):
- File: [`game.js`](file://e:\tank-arena\public\game.js) - Lines 1536-1546
- Shows upgrade screen
- Handles selection
- Updates vehicle images

### Test Each Vehicle Type:
1. **Select Tank** → Should show tank_basic images
2. **Gain XP** → Should level up and show tank_medium, tank_heavy, etc.
3. **Select Jeep** → Should show jeep_basic images
4. **Level up** → Should show jeep_combat, jeep_assault, etc.

6. **Level up** → Should show apc_heavy, apc_battle, apc_commando, apc_elite
7. **Select Artillery** → Should show artillery_basic images
8. **Level up** → Should show artillery_heavy, artillery_battle, artillery_plasma, artillery_elite
9. **Select Helicopter** → Should show helicopter_basic_body with spinning rotor
