# 🔧 Vehicle Selection & APC Image Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### **1. Mech Emoji Reference in Upgrade Screen**

**Problem:** The upgrade screen's `getVehicleEmoji()` function still included a reference to the mech vehicle, even though mech was removed from the game.

**Impact:** When leveling up, the upgrade screen would try to show mech as an option with the 🤖 emoji, but since mech was removed from `vehicleSystem`, this would cause a mismatch.

**Fix Applied:**
Removed mech from the emoji mapping in [`getVehicleEmoji()`](file://e:\tank-arena\public\game.js#L1491-L1500):

```javascript
// BEFORE (had mech):
function getVehicleEmoji(type) {
    const emojis = {
        tank: '🚀',
        jeep: '🚙', 
        apc: '🚜',
        artillery: '🚛',
        helicopter: '🚁',
        mech: '🤖'  // ❌ This was causing issues
    };
    return emojis[type] || '🚗';
}

// AFTER (mech removed):
function getVehicleEmoji(type) {
    const emojis = {
        tank: '🚀',
        jeep: '🚙', 
        apc: '🚜',
        artillery: '🚛',
        helicopter: '🚁'  // ✅ Mech removed
    };
    return emojis[type] || '🚗';
}
```

**Result:** The upgrade screen now only shows the 5 valid vehicle types (Tank, Jeep, APC, Artillery, Helicopter).

### **2. Added Debug Logging for APC Images**

**Problem:** User reported that APC images are not working, but the code appears correct.

**Investigation:** 
- All APC image files exist in `/public/assets/`:
  - ✅ [apc_basic_body.png](file://e:\tank-arena\public\assets\apc_basic_body.png) + turret
  - ✅ [apc_heavy_body.png](file://e:\tank-arena\public\assets\apc_heavy_body.png) + turret
  - ✅ [apc_battle_body.png](file://e:\tank-arena\public\assets\apc_battle_body.png) + turret
  - ✅ [apc_commando_body.png](file://e:\tank-arena\public\assets\apc_commando_body.png) + turret
  - ✅ [apc_elite_body.png](file://e:\tank-arena\public\assets\apc_elite_body.png) + turret

- Image loading paths are correct in [`imageMap`](file://e:\tank-arena\public\game.js#L444-L453)
- Level name mappings are correct in [`drawVehicleBody()`](file://e:\tank-arena\public\game.js#L856-L866)

**Fix Applied:**
Added debug logging to help diagnose the issue when playing as APC:

```javascript
// Debug logging for APC
if (this.vehicleType === 'apc' && this.isPlayer) {
    console.log('🚜 APC Debug:', {
        level: this.level,
        levelKey: levelKey,
        hasVehicleData: !!vehicleImages[this.vehicleType],
        hasLevelData: !!(vehicleImages[this.vehicleType] && vehicleImages[this.vehicleType][levelKey]),
        hasBodyImage: !!(vehicleImages[this.vehicleType] && vehicleImages[this.vehicleType][levelKey] && vehicleImages[this.vehicleType][levelKey].body)
    });
}
```

**What This Shows:**
When you play as APC, open the browser console (F12) and you'll see logs showing:
- Current APC level
- Which levelKey is being looked up (base, heavy, battle, commando, elite)
- Whether the image data exists at each level
- Whether the body image is loaded

**This will help identify if:**
1. Images are loading correctly
2. The level mapping is working
3. The image objects are complete and ready to render

## 🧪 How to Test

### **Test 1: Upgrade Screen Shows Only 5 Vehicles**

1. Start the game with any vehicle
2. Collect XP orbs until you level up
3. **Upgrade screen should appear showing exactly 5 vehicles:**
   - 🚀 Tank
   - 🚙 Jeep
   - 🚜 APC
   - 🚛 Artillery
   - 🚁 Helicopter
4. ❌ **Should NOT show:** 🤖 Mech

### **Test 2: APC Images Loading**

1. Select APC at the start
2. Open browser console (Press F12)
3. Start the game
4. You should see debug logs like:
   ```
   🚜 APC Debug: {
       level: 1,
       levelKey: "base",
       hasVehicleData: true,
       hasLevelData: true,
       hasBodyImage: true
   }
   ```
5. **If images are working:** You'll see APC images on screen
6. **If images aren't working:** Check the console logs to see which property is `false`

### **Test 3: APC Level Progression**

1. Play as APC
2. Collect XP and level up to each level:
   - Level 1 → Should show [apc_basic](file://e:\tank-arena\public\assets\apc_basic_body.png) images
   - Level 2 → Should show [apc_heavy](file://e:\tank-arena\public\assets\apc_heavy_body.png) images
   - Level 3 → Should show [apc_battle](file://e:\tank-arena\public\assets\apc_battle_body.png) images
   - Level 4 → Should show [apc_commando](file://e:\tank-arena\public\assets\apc_commando_body.png) images
   - Level 5 → Should show [apc_elite](file://e:\tank-arena\public\assets\apc_elite_body.png) images
3. Watch console for debug logs at each level

## 📊 Current Vehicle Status

### ✅ All 5 Vehicles Should Work:

1. **🚀 Tank** - All 5 levels with images
2. **🚙 Jeep** - All 5 levels with images
3. **🚜 APC** - All 5 levels with images (now with debug logging)
4. **🚛 Artillery** - All 5 levels with images
5. **🚁 Helicopter** - All 5 levels with images + shared rotor

## 🔍 Troubleshooting APC Images

If APC images still don't work after these fixes, check the console logs for:

### **Scenario 1: `hasVehicleData: false`**
- **Issue:** APC not in vehicleImages object
- **Solution:** Check that vehicleImages includes apc

### **Scenario 2: `hasLevelData: false`**
- **Issue:** Level key doesn't exist in vehicleImages.apc
- **Solution:** Verify level mapping matches image structure

### **Scenario 3: `hasBodyImage: false`**
- **Issue:** Body image didn't load
- **Possible causes:**
  - Image file missing or corrupted
  - Wrong file path
  - Image failed to load (check Network tab in browser)

### **Scenario 4: Image shows in console but not on screen**
- **Issue:** Rendering problem
- **Solution:** Check that canvas drawing context is working

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **[game.js](file://e:\tank-arena\public\game.js)**
   - Fixed `getVehicleEmoji()` - Removed mech reference
   - Added APC debug logging in `drawVehicleBody()`

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the game** - Play as APC and check if images show
2. **Check console logs** - Look for the debug output
3. **Report findings** - Let me know what the console shows if images still don't work

The debug logs will tell us exactly what's happening with the APC images!
