# Tank Arena - Latest Improvements

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the latest improvements made to Tank Arena to fix the armored APC image issue, enhance mobile controls, and add engaging sound effects.

---

## üé® 1. Fixed Armored APC Image Issue

### Problem
The level 1 APC (Armored APC) image wasn't loading because the code was looking for `'base'` level but the actual image files use `'basic'` naming.

### Solution
Changed all level 1 mapping from `'base'` to `'basic'` to match the actual image file names:
- `apc_basic_body.png`
- `apc_basic_turret.png`
- And same for all other vehicles (tank, jeep, artillery, helicopter)

### Files Modified
- `public/game.js` - Updated `levelMaps` in both `drawVehicleBody()` and `drawTurret()` methods
- `public/game.js` - Updated `vehicleImages` object structure
- `public/game.js` - Updated image loading map

## üì± 2. Enhanced Mobile Controls

### Previous Behavior
- Touch area on left side only for movement
- Fire button on right side only for shooting
- Limited movement control

### New Behavior
**Drag-to-Move System:**
- Drag anywhere on the screen to move your vehicle
- Vehicle rotates smoothly toward drag direction
- Vehicle moves based on drag distance (further drag = faster movement)
- Turret aims at the drag target location

**Tap-to-Fire System:**
- Quick tap anywhere on screen fires a bullet
- Tap duration threshold: 200ms (shorter = fire, longer = move)
- Turret automatically aims at tap location
- Fire button still available as backup

### Implementation Details
```javascript
// Touch controls now on canvas directly
canvas.addEventListener('touchstart', ...)  // Detect touch start
canvas.addEventListener('touchmove', ...)   // Track drag movement
canvas.addEventListener('touchend', ...)    // Detect tap vs drag
```

**Smart Detection:**
- Tracks touch duration to distinguish taps from drags
- Minimum drag distance (5px) to avoid jitter
- Smooth angle interpolation for natural vehicle rotation
- World-to-screen coordinate conversion for accurate aiming

### Files Modified
- `public/game.js` - Replaced touch area listeners with canvas listeners
- `public/game.js` - Enhanced `Vehicle.update()` method for better mobile movement
- `public/game.js` - Added tap detection and firing logic

## üîä 3. Sound Effects System

### Sound Effects Added

**1. Shoot Sound** üî´
- Plays when firing bullets
- Clean "pew!" electronic sound at 800Hz
- Duration: 100ms

**2. Hit Sound** üí•

- Impact "thud" using sawtooth wave at 200Hz
- Duration: 150ms

**3. Explosion Sound** üí£

### Technical Implementation

**Web Audio API:**

- No external audio files needed
- Zero latency
- Works on all modern browsers

**Smart Initialization:**
- Sounds initialize on first user interaction (required by browsers)
- Graceful fallback if audio not supported
- Enable/disable toggle available

**Sound Triggers:**
- `sounds.shoot()` - Called in `Vehicle.shoot()` method
- `sounds.hit()` - Called on `player-hit` socket event
- `sounds.explosion()` - Called on `player-killed` socket event
- `sounds.xpCollect()` - Called on `resource-collected` for XP
- `sounds.levelUp()` - Called on `show-upgrade-screen` event

### Files Modified
- `public/game.js` - Added sound system initialization (100+ lines)
- `public/game.js` - Added `ensureSoundsInitialized()` function
- `public/game.js` - Integrated sound calls into all relevant events
