## üîß Technical Implementation

### Web Audio API

Tank Arena uses the **Web Audio API** for all sound generation:

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Zero latency - sounds play instantly
- ‚úÖ No external files - all sounds generated procedurally
- ‚úÖ Small bandwidth - no audio assets to download
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform - works on all modern browsers
- ‚úÖ Dynamic - can adjust sounds based on game state

**Browser Support:**
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (full support)
- ‚úÖ Firefox (full support)
- ‚úÖ Safari (iOS/macOS - full support)
- ‚úÖ Opera (full support)

---

## üéÆ Sound System Architecture

### Initialization

```javascript
// Sounds initialize on first user interaction
ensureSoundsInitialized();
```

**Why delayed initialization?**
- Browsers require user gesture before playing audio
- Auto-play policies prevent sounds on page load
- First click/tap activates audio context

**When sounds initialize:**
1. Game start button click
2. First mouse click (desktop)
3. First touch event (mobile)

---

### Sound Playback Flow

```
Game Event ‚Üí Check if enabled ‚Üí Create oscillator ‚Üí Play sound ‚Üí Auto-cleanup
```

**Example: Shooting**
```javascript
// In Vehicle.shoot() method
socket.emit('bullet-fired', {...});
if (sounds.shoot) sounds.shoot();  // Play sound
explosions.push(...);  // Visual effect
```

---

## üéõÔ∏è Customization

### Volume Levels

Current volume settings (0.0 - 1.0 scale):

| Sound | Volume | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Shoot | 0.3 | Frequent action, medium volume |
| Hit | 0.4 | Important feedback, slightly louder |
| Explosion | 0.5 | Dramatic moment, loudest |
| Level Up | 0.3 | Celebration, pleasant volume |
| XP Collect | 0.2 | Frequent action, subtle |

### Enable/Disable Sounds

**Global Toggle:**
```javascript
sounds.enabled = false;  // Disable all sounds
sounds.enabled = true;   // Re-enable sounds
```

**Individual Control:**
Each sound checks `sounds.enabled` before playing:
```javascript
if (!sounds.enabled) return;
```

## üîç Sound Event Mapping

### Client-Side Events

| Event | Socket Event | Sound Triggered |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Fire weapon | `bullet-fired` | `shoot()` |
| Take damage | `player-hit` | `hit()` |
| Player dies | `player-killed` | `explosion()` |
| Collect XP | `resource-collected` | `xpCollect()` |
| Level up | `show-upgrade-screen` | `levelUp()` |

---

## üìä Audio Context Details

### Oscillator Types Used

**Sine Wave** (Smooth, musical)
- Used for: Shoot, Level Up, XP Collect
- Character: Clean, pleasant tones

**Sawtooth Wave** (Harsh, mechanical)
- Used for: Hit, Explosion
- Character: Aggressive, impactful sounds

### Gain Envelopes

All sounds use **exponential decay** for natural fade-out:

```javascript
gainNode.gain.setValueAtTime(startVolume, startTime);
gainNode.gain.exponentialRampToValueAtTime(0.01, endTime);
```

This creates professional-sounding audio with smooth endings.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Sounds Not Playing?

**Check 1: Browser Compatibility**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for "üîä Sound effects initialized" message
- If not present, audio initialization failed

**Check 2: User Interaction**
- Sounds require user gesture to activate
- Click/tap once anywhere to initialize

**Check 3: Browser Permissions**
- Ensure browser isn't muted
- Check site permissions for audio
- Some browsers block autoplay - need manual interaction

**Check 4: Audio Context State**
- Audio context must be "running"
- Some mobile browsers suspend audio when tab is inactive

### Common Issues

**Issue: Sounds play once then stop**
- Solution: Audio context suspended - tap screen to resume

**Issue: Sounds delayed or laggy**
- Solution: Browser performance issue - close other tabs

**Issue: No sound on iOS**
- Solution: iOS requires explicit user interaction - tap fire button once

## üé® Future Enhancement Ideas

### Potential Additions
1. **Ambient sounds** - Background arena noise
2. **Engine sounds** - Different per vehicle type
3. **Ricochet sounds** - Bullets hitting obstacles
4. **Reload sounds** - During fire cooldown
5. **Vehicle movement** - Treads, wheels, rotors
6. **Menu sounds** - Button clicks, selections
7. **Music** - Background soundtrack (toggleable)
8. **Voice lines** - "Level up!", "Eliminated!"

### Advanced Features
- **3D spatial audio** - Sound direction based on source position
- **Dynamic mixing** - Reduce music volume during combat
- **Doppler effect** - Pitch shift for moving vehicles
- **Environmental reverb** - Echo in different map areas

---

## üìà Performance Impact

### Resource Usage

**CPU:** Negligible (< 1%)
- Oscillators are very efficient
- Auto-cleanup prevents memory leaks
- No continuous processing when silent

**Memory:** Minimal (< 100 KB)
- No audio files loaded
- AudioContext reused across sounds
- Oscillators destroyed after playback

**Bandwidth:** Zero
- All sounds generated client-side
- No network requests for audio

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### For Players
1. Allow audio permissions when prompted
2. Keep browser tab active for best audio performance
3. Use headphones for immersive experience
4. Adjust system volume to comfortable level

### For Developers
1. Always check `sounds.enabled` before playing
2. Destroy oscillators after use (automatic with `.stop()`)
3. Use exponential ramps for natural sound fade
4. Keep sound durations short for frequent effects
5. Test on multiple browsers and devices
