## 🐛 Why Other Vehicles Weren't Working

The issue was that the **display names in the game code didn't match the actual image file names**. For example:

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
// Code was looking for:
apc_assault_body.png  // ❌ File doesn't exist!
apc_titan_body.png    // ❌ File doesn't exist!

artillery_siege_body.png   // ❌ File doesn't exist!
artillery_mobile_body.png  // ❌ File doesn't exist!
artillery_super_body.png   // ❌ File doesn't exist!

helicopter_heavy_body.png  // ❌ File doesn't exist!
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// Code now looks for:
apc_commando_body.png  // ✅ File exists!
apc_elite_body.png     // ✅ File exists!

artillery_battle_body.png  // ✅ File exists!
artillery_plasma_body.png  // ✅ File exists!
artillery_elite_body.png   // ✅ File exists!

helicopter_stealth_body.png // ✅ File exists!
```
